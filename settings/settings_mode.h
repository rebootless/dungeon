/*
A third IMode alongside GameMode and EditorMode — see core/mode.h. A real
settings screen: one full-window panel, framed on all four sides, with no
map and no left/right split. Two columns — SETTING (category) and OPTION
(that category's values) — navigated with AWSD and confirmed with SPACE;
the currently focused entry (whichever column has keyboard focus) is
drawn in yellow, same convention EditorMode uses for its selected palette
tile.

App::run() enters this mode FIRST, before GameMode, so a fresh launch
always starts by letting the player confirm/choose a resolution — see
that comment for why the window itself starts pinned to the smallest
preset rather than whatever the OS handed back.

Currently only the Resolution category is actually interactive; Volume is
listed (per the request to leave room for it) but has no real audio
system behind it yet — see settings_mode.cpp's onEvent for both.

ESC toggles this screen open/closed from ANY mode (Game/EditorMode's own
ESC handlers just call context_.switchMode(make_unique<SettingsMode>())
— see game_controls.cpp / editor_controls.cpp) rather than quitting; Q is
the only thing that quits, in every mode. Settings itself doesn't know
which mode it was opened FROM on its own, so the opening mode records
that here via setReturnMode() right before switching — ESC pressed while
already in Settings reads it back to know whether to return to Game or
Editor. Defaults to Game so the very first launch (App::run() switches
straight into Settings with nothing set) still has a sane ESC target.
