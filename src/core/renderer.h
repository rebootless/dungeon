Frame system
FrameBuilder draws panel and divider borders without each mode having to
hand-derive "corner vs edge" itself, and without special-casing where a
panel divider meets the outer border. Mark every cell that should carry
border art (outer edges, plus any interior divider lines), then draw()
decides the correct tile for each marked cell purely from how many of its
4 neighbours are also marked:

  2 opposite neighbours (left+right)  -> HORIZONTAL_BORDER
  2 opposite neighbours (up+down)     -> VERTICAL_BORDER
  anything else (a corner, a T where
  a divider meets the outer edge, or
  a cross where two dividers meet)    -> CORNER_BORDER

CORNER_BORDER's sprite (assets/border_corner.png — one of the five
special sprites hardcoded in this file, never part of tiles.json; see
core/tiles.h's "Special sprites" section) is a full 4-way connector:
drawn as both a horizontal AND a vertical bar through the same cell — the
exact same tile therefore reads correctly as a corner, a T-junction, or a
full cross, so one sprite is all this needs.

Cells are addressed by raw canvas pixel position, not grid index, so a
frame can be docked anywhere.
