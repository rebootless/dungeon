resolveInteractionAnchor
Multi-cell Objects-layer sprites (currently: 1x2 doors, the 1x2 wardrobe)
only register their TOP-LEFT anchor tile in interactions.cpp's table —
every other cell of the footprint holds a raw sub-tile stamped by
replaceFootprint (the anchor's TileID with a (dx,dy) offset baked in, see
game_mode.cpp), which isn't a registered interaction key on its own. So
facing anything but the anchor itself (e.g. the bottom half of a door)
makes a direct findInteraction() lookup fail even though the object very
much has a registered interaction.

This walks backward from (fx, fy) looking for a cell whose tile, offset by
(dx, dy), would produce exactly the raw tile the player is facing — i.e.
"is (fx, fy) cell (dx, dy) inside SOME anchor's footprint", searching
backward from the facing cell rather than forward from a spritesheet scan.
kMaxSpan bounds the search to the largest footprint any registered tile
could plausibly have; every real object today is only 1x2, so this rarely
walks more than one cell.
