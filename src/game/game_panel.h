GameMode info panel layout
Text drawn into the info box below the map (see GameMode::render() in
game_mode.cpp) and into the two side panels. All three follow the same
shape: a std::vector<std::string>, one row per entry, top to bottom,
drawn by game_mode.cpp's drawPanelLines(). The info box is capped at 12
rows (row 11 as bottom margin — 12 is the hard ceiling, see
core/layout.h's UI_BOX_ROWS); the side panels run the full canvas height
and can hold as many rows as needed — the left panel's stat block in
particular is open-ended (see buildLeftPanelLines below).

    afterward; the rest are still plain placeholder text. See
