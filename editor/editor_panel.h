/*
EditorMode panel layout
Row indices for the text drawn into the info box below the map (see
EditorMode::onRender() in editor_mode.cpp). Row 0 is the panel's own top
row; UI_BOX_ROWS (core/layout.h) is 13, so row indices here must stay
within [0, 11] to leave the box's last row as a clean bottom margin — 12
rows is the hard ceiling.

Purely the STATIC layout/text — anything that depends on live state
(which layer is active, the transient save/load status message, the
current world coordinate) still gets assembled in editor_mode.cpp, since
only that file has the data; this file just says which row it goes on
and supplies the wording that never changes at runtime.
